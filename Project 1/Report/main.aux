However, there are other kinds of governor in which the centrifugal piece is free to move from the axis of rotation but is balanced by a centrifugal force and the force of gravity (or by the spring force, in some cases).\newline  $(a) .$ Name an example of this alternative type of Governor system.\newline  $(b) .$ Explain how this difference can affect the stability conditions of the system.}{3}}
